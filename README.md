- 🧹 **Clear Profile** - Easily unset your AWS profile when needed
- 🎨 **Colorful Output** - Visual feedback with colored terminal output
- 💨 **Zero Dependencies** - Works with just AWS CLI (fzf optional but recommended)

## 📦 Installation

### Quick Install (Recommended)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rnihesh/awsp/main/install.sh | bash
```

Or with wget:

```bash
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rnihesh/awsp/main/install.sh | bash
```

### Manual Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rnihesh/awsp.git ~/.awsp
```

2. **Add to your shell configuration:**

For **Zsh** (`~/.zshrc`):

```bash
[ -f ~/.awsp/awsp.sh ] && . ~/.awsp/awsp.sh
```

For **Bash** (`~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile`):

```bash
[ -f ~/.awsp/awsp.sh ] && . ~/.awsp/awsp.sh
```

3. **Reload your shell:**

```bash
source ~/.zshrc  # or source ~/.bashrc
```

## 🚀 Usage

### Switch Profile (Interactive)

```bash
awsp
```

This opens an interactive fuzzy finder (if `fzf` is installed) or a numbered selection menu to choose your AWS profile.

### Switch to Specific Profile

```bash
awsp my-profile-name
```

Directly switch to a known profile without the interactive menu.

### Clear Current Profile

```bash
awsp clear
# or
awsp none
```

Unsets the `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable.

### Check Current Profile

```bash
awsp-current
```

Shows which AWS profile is currently active.

## 📖 Use Cases

### 🏢 Multi-Account Management

Perfect for DevOps engineers and developers managing multiple AWS accounts:

```bash
# Switch to development
$ awsp dev-account
AWS_PROFILE=dev-account
✓ Identity verified
{
    "UserId": "AIDAXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
    "Account": "111111111111",
    "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::111111111111:user/developer"
}

# Quick switch to production
$ awsp prod-account
AWS_PROFILE=prod-account
✓ Identity verified
```

### 🔐 SSO Workflow

Seamlessly handles AWS SSO authentication:

```bash
$ awsp sso-profile
AWS_PROFILE=sso-profile
SSO token expired for profile 'sso-profile'
Run aws sso login now? [y/N]: y
# Browser opens for SSO authentication
✓ SSO login successful
```

### 🔄 CI/CD Local Testing

Test your CI/CD pipelines locally with different credentials:

```bash
# Test with CI role
$ awsp ci-deploy-role
$ terraform plan

# Switch back to admin for fixes
$ awsp admin
```

### 🧹 Clean Environment

Reset to default credentials:

```bash
$ awsp clear
AWS_PROFILE cleared

# Now using default profile or instance role
$ aws sts get-caller-identity
```
